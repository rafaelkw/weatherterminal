Installation Instructions
*************************

System requirements:

  * C++ toolchain such as g++ 7 or later
  * CMake version 3.5 or later
  * Qt 5 toolkit
  * Community QtWebKit version 5.212 or later
  * Python 2.7 (to run the tests)


Installation on Linux
---------------------

Due to the required QtWebKit >= 5.212, only the following distributions will
be supported:

  * Debian 10 (buster) or later
  * Ubuntu 18.04 (bionic) or later
  * Fedora 28 or later

On Debian/Ubuntu, the requirements can be fulfilled by installing these packages:

  sudo apt install g++ cmake qt5-default libqt5webkit5-dev python

After unpacking the source tarball or cloning the repository:

  ./configure && make

Do a quick sanity check:

  ./bin/phantomjs --version

Run the test suite:

  make check

Install it (may require sudo):

  make install


Installation on Windows
-----------------------

Only MinGW is supported for now.

First, install MSYS2.

Then, from "MYS2 MinGW64 32-bit" shell, install the required packages:

  pacman -S msys/make
  pacman -S mingw32/mingw-w64-i686-toolchain
  pacman -S mingw32/mingw-w64-i686-cmake
  pacman -S mingw32/mingw-w64-i686-qtwebkit
  pacman -S mingw32/mingw-w64-i686-python2

Note: add --disable-download-timeout as an additional argument, if the
installation failed due to the slow server responses.

After unpacking the source tarball or cloning the repository:

  cmake . -G "MinGW Makefiles"

And then start the build process:

  make

Do a quick sanity check:

  ./bin/phantomjs.exe --version


Installation on macOS
